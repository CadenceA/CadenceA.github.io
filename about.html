    <p> This site was created in <strong>3</strong> hours at the end of a four day web design class for 14+.
         The creator of this particular site had never touched programming or web design until said class.
          The site is meant to be used as a motivational page, and only that. 
          No more will be added to the site as it was made for fun.
           That being said I hope that this page helped you relax and gave you some advice on how to ease a bit of your troubles. 
           Remember, <em> The greatest weapon against stress is our <strong>ability</strong> to <strong>choose</strong> one thought over another. ~William James
